Comparison of Flutter and React Native in terms of architecture and performance.

1️⃣ Programming Language
Flutter: Uses Dart, compiles to native ARM code.
React Native: Uses JavaScript, communicates via JS Bridge.
🔹 Impact: Flutter offers better performance due to direct compilation.
2️⃣ Architecture
Flutter: Uses Skia rendering engine, does not rely on native UI components.
React Native: Uses Fabric (New) or Bridge (Old), renders with native components.
🔹 Impact: Flutter provides consistent UI, React Native offers a more native feel.
3️⃣ UI Components
Flutter: Custom widgets (Material, Cupertino), no native dependency.
React Native: Uses native UI elements, updates via Virtual DOM.
🔹 Impact: Flutter ensures identical UI on all devices, React Native feels more native.
4️⃣ Performance
Flutter: Direct native compilation = Higher performance.
React Native: JS bridge dependency (unless using Fabric) = Possible slowdowns.
🔹 Impact: Flutter excels in animations & complex UI, Fabric improves React Native.
5️⃣ Native Module Support
Flutter: Uses platform channels for native features, less third-party support.
React Native: Rich native library ecosystem, easier native module integration.
🔹 Impact: Flutter more stable long-term, React Native faster native integration.
6️⃣ Community & Ecosystem
Flutter: Backed by Google, fast-growing, but smaller community.
React Native: Backed by Meta (Facebook), larger ecosystem & more libraries.
🔹 Impact: React Native has more resources & job opportunities, Flutter is growing rapidly.
🛠️ Which One to Choose?
✅ For performance & unified UI → Flutter
✅ For native integration & larger community → React Native
✅ For startups & MVPs → React Native
✅ For long-term stability → Flutter

🚀 Both are great choices! Select based on your project needs.
